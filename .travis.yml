# Notes:
#   This repo builds a Rebar3 plugin, and running dialyzer on it from within
#   Rebar3 is dicey, so it's not included as an automated build step here.
#   Differences between the version of Rebar3 running the tests and the head
#   of the master branch, which is downloaded as a dependency, can cause
#   Rebar3 to crash in mysterious ways.
#   Dialyzer should only be run on this repo in a controlled environment where
#   issues can be addressed as they arise.
